# SQL - Cumulative Lab

## Summary

In this lesson, we produced several data queries for a model car company, mainly focused around its customer data. Along the way, we reviewed many of the major concepts and keywords associated with SQL `SELECT` queries: `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`, `SUM`, `COUNT`, and `AVG`.

## Editors Comments
This was a pretty fair lab, it covers the main topics in SQL within the 8 qns asked. I would rate it 4/10 in terms of complexity. The last two questions were the ones that needed abit more thinking but overal it was a good lab.
